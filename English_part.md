What is an Array?
https://devdocs.io/python~3.9/library/array - Here is where I found arrays and how to use it. It is my first time so im still trying to figure out how to use arrays in the copilot, im not really figuring it out, but I understand the concept of it. It is a variable that stores the same types of things in a single variable name. It provides a way to organize and arrange things of the same type. It is different from list because array has to be the same type. We also know the size or amount of arrays there are when we create them. I do understand the differences but im having a hard time figuring out the coding part specifically with arrays. Array is a highly organized thing with rules like ordered in a meaningful way. An array has portability.

What is a List?
https://devdocs.io/python~3.9/library/stdtypes#list - Here is where I found lists on python. Lists are just a sequence of something. A list can be anything though, not just things of the same type. So a list is much more dynamic, and arrays are more fixed. A list has a lot less rules then an Array, a list can be a bunch of things ordered in any manner, it could even be a collection of nothing.
