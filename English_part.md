What is an Array?
https://devdocs.io/python~3.9/library/array - Here is where I found arrays and how to use it. It is my first time so im still trying to figure out how to use arrays in the copilot, im not really figuring it out, but I understand the concept of it. It is a variable that stores the same types of things in a single variable name. It provides a way to organize and arrange things. It is different from list because array has to be the same type.

What is a List?
https://devdocs.io/python~3.9/library/stdtypes#list - Here is where I found lists on python. Lists are just a sequence of something. A list can be anything though, not just things of the same type. So a list is much more dynamic, and arrays are more fixed.
