What is a stack in python?

A stack in Python is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out principle (LIFO). From my obervation, it is basically the opposite of a list, where in a list the oldest thing is first, but in a stack the YOUNGEST thing is first. This means the LAST element added to the STACK is the FIST one to be removed. It functions like a stack of books, where you can only add or remove books from the top. You use push and pop to add and remove elements to the stack. Pop removes elements and Push adds elements to a list. Instead of using PUSH, I have been using .append which seems to function the same way. In a stack, both insertion and deletion happen at the same end, which is at the top of the stack. Stacks bascially are implemented from a list using different data structures. Also after researching it, are there even official stacks in python, or does it just use a List which is (FIFO) function and change it to (LIFO)?
