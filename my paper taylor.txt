	The concept I am planning on working on is libraries in python that you can use for cybersecurtiy. One library is the requests library. It simplifies making HTTP requests, which is useful for interacting with web APIs and testing web vulnerabilities. There is also a interesting library called Scapy. Scapy is a library for network packet manipulation, enabling you to craft, send and analyze packets. It’s widely used for scanning networks, and even packet sniffing which seems very pretty powerful and I look forward to trying it out. Another really cool libary that I would like to learn about related to cybersecurity is Cryptograpyhy library. Cryptography library provides robust encryption and decryption capabilities, allowing you to secure data through various cryptographic operations. With a simple python code, you can generate a cipher and encrypt it, and also decrypt it in seconds. You can use the cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring secure data transmission. You can also build a Port scanner which seems very powerful. A port scanner helps you identify open ports on a target system, that cybersecurity would find very useful to assess vulnerabilities.
